    <h1 class="underline">Introduction to HTML</h1>
    <p>HTML(<span class="bold underline">H</span>yper<span class="bold underline">T</span>ext <span class="bold underline">M</span>arkup <span class="bold underline">L</span>anguage) is the code that is used to structure a webpage an its content.<br/>
For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points or using images and data tables </p>
 <h2> So What is HTML?</h2>
 <p>HTML is a <strong>markup language</strong> that defines the structure of your content. it consists of a series <em>elements</em> which you use to enclose, or wrap different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way. For example, if we wanted to a line to stand by itself, we could secify that it is a paragraph b enclosing it in paragragh tags:

 <p> The main parts of an HTML element are as follows:</p>
 <ol> 
     <li><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element(e.g p) wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect.</li>
     <li><strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the closing tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends- in this case where the paragraph ends.</li>
     <li><strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element, which in this case is just text.</li> 
     <li><strong>The element:</strong> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element. </li>
 </ol>
     <h2>Summary</h2>
     <p> HTML is a markup language used to describe the structure and content of a webpage. it says what content should be on  webpage. An HTML document is made up of a series of elements. Some elements we covered in this lesson are:</p>
